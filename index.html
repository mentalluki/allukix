                    <p>Life is one big psychological warfare you play on yourself. Its what you say to yourself every single day, You are at war with your mind every single day. Your mind is a perfect ground for training yourself.</p>

                <div class="quote">
                    <p>In the past, I always faced my problems on a surface level, but when something bad happens, I quit. "Man, I thought I fixed this". So I went deep into the dungeon of my soul to find out what makes me quit. So I put my sword in the fire repeatedly. I said, "we can't quit, we have to figure out why you quit". And eventually after too much beating, I noticed my brain is getting hard. You can't dissect your brain in a normal situation. Dissect your brain when its miserable.</p>
